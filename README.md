# sumoRefactoringKata

The challenge of this kata is primarily to refactor the test to be a descriptive specification of the component's functionality.

Refactoring of the component under test may also be useful.

## Concepts

- Test behavior, not implementation

- Tests are working specifications that do not lie

- Test-driven development is example-driven development (Martin Fowler) 

- “Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.”
  ― Harold Abelson, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
